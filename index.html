          <h3>TripleHack 2024</h3>
          <p>
            The debut edition of TripleHack held in July 2024 brought together 120+ participants from across Nigeria and Ghana. With themes like Education, HealthTech, and Rural Innovation, teams pushed the limits of what can be built in a weekend. The winning team developed a mobile app that helps out-of-school youth access free learning paths using WhatsApp bots. Judges praised the creativity, resilience, and teamwork shown by all groups. The success of this first edition inspired the bigger 2025 edition.

          <h3>TripleMeet 2024</h3>
          <p>
            TripleMeet 2024 was a laid-back community event designed to bring together devs, designers, and digital builders to simply vibe, connect, and share their journeys. Held outdoors with food, chill music, and lightning talks, it created room for people to link up in person after months of building alone. It was a safe space to rant about bugs, share project struggles, and even meet future collaborators. Some say it was the soul of the TripleA community.
