# Event Hub 🗓️

A beginner-friendly semantic HTML project showcasing fictional upcoming and past events organized by the TripleAStackDev community.

This was built as part of my practice during the **freeCodeCamp Semantic HTML module** and serves as my first *real* project with a clear purpose and structure.
